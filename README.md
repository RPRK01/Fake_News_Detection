## Project Overview

Fake news is a growing problem, affecting public opinion, elections, and social awareness.  
This project builds a **Machine Learning model** to classify news articles as **“Fake”** or **“Real”** using:

- **Naive Bayes Classifier**  
- **TF-IDF Vectorization**  

It is **easy to run, interpretable, and scalable**, making it ideal for resume projects and portfolios.

## Key Features

- ✅ Detects Fake vs Real news  
- ✅ Uses public datasets (`Fake.csv` & `True.csv`)  
- ✅ High accuracy (~95–97%)  
- ✅ Simple Python implementation  
- ✅ Extensible to a web app using Flask

## Tech Stack

- **Programming Language:** Python 3  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, Scikit-learn  
- **ML Model:** Multinomial Naive Bayes  
- **Text Processing:** TF-IDF Vectorization

## Dataset

- **Fake.csv** – Collection of fake news articles  
- **True.csv** – Collection of real news articles  
- **Source:** [Kaggle - Fake and Real News Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset)  

> You can also include the dataset as `data.zip` in your repo and unzip it before running.
